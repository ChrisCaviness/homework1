Link to final page: https://chriscaviness.github.io/homework1/

1.) Adjusted the List Elements in the header to be on single lines so they are easier to read.

2.) Seperated the <div class="hero"> main image area from being one line under the header so it has a more obvious section away from all the header content.

3.) Separated the different sections into <section> tags rather than just <div>

4.) Adjusted the formatting of the Search Engine Optimization / Online Reputation Management / Social Media Marketing sections so you can clearly see the cascading elements within the <div> areas.

5.) Adjusted the formatting of the Lead Generation / Brand Awareness / Cost Management sections so you can clearly see the cascading elements within the right most areas.

6.) Changed the name of the element for all the content on the right side of the screen to <aside>

7.) Adjusted the formatting of the footer section so you can clearly see the cascading elements within the <footer> area.

8.) Adjusted the navigation section of the header from <div> to <nav>
    - had to change the CSS naming from "header div" to "header nav" for the CSS to show the navigation links properly. 

9.) Adjusted the larger contents on the left from <div> to <main> as they appear to be the main portion of the page.

10.) Added alt text to all images. 7 images total.

11.) Added comments to all sections of HTML for ease of use navigation.

12.) Added comments to all sections of CSS for easy understanding of where it is applied to.
